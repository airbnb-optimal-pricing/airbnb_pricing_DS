# Airbnb Price Navigator DS 

For this project the data science team is tasked with creating an API that will return a price prediction given a set of parameters determined to have the highest feature importance in the airbnb dataset downloaded [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). This repo is divided between the Flask API and python notebooks. <br>
