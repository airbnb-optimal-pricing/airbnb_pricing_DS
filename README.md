# Airbnb Price Navigator DS 

For this project the data science team is tasked with creating an API that will return a price prediction given a set of parameters determined to have the highest feature importance in the airbnb dataset downloaded [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). This repo is divided between the Flask API and python notebooks. <br>

## [Flask API](https://github.com/airbnb-optimal-pricing/airbnb_pricing_DS/tree/master/eb-flask) 
Contains files needed for data scraping, cleaning, and modeling. 

## [Notebook Analysis](https://github.com/airbnb-optimal-pricing/airbnb_pricing_DS/tree/master/notebooks)
We wanted to include the notebooks to show users the steps we took in arriving at the final model. The notebook section also contains general analysis on the dataset that airbnb hosts will find useful.
